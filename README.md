# digital-profile.github.io
A visual profile of people in the digital age.


##Instructions.
* Navigate to the folder containing this program in terminal.
* Download the latest sheets of the datapoints, tags and references as tab separated value (.tsv) files. They should be titled 'Digital Profile - Bibliography.tsv' etc.
* Place them in the Data folder.
* Run them through transform.js by typing 'node transform.js' in the terminal.
* This creates 'output.js' in the Data folder, which is the file graph.js uses to build the graph. Note that because it is a string, not a true JSON file, it may cause your computer to slow if opened.
* The graph should be loaded on the index.html page.
