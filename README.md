##Instructions.
* I have changed the tags spreadsheet slightly to make it easier to format. Check 'EditedTags.tsv' for an example.
* Download the latest sheets of the tags and datapoints as a tab separated value (.tsv) file.
* Run EditedTags.tsv through transform.js by typing ' node transform.js EditedTags.tsv' in the console.
* This results in 'output.json', which is the file graph.js uses to build the graph.
