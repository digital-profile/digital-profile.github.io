# digital-profile.github.io
A visual profile of people in the digital age.


Temporary Process: Run DigitalProfile.tsv through stanTrans.js to get nodes and links for data points.
Run EditedTags.tsv through tags.js to get tagOutput.json, the nodes of the categories.
Copy the category and data point nodes into a JSON file and run that through trans2.js to get the links.
You might need a little finessing, but this data should result in a force-directed-graph-ready, data structure.
